IPCCourse: Programming in C
=========

The best way to learn is to create a series of 
immersive notes embedded into code, where we attempt 
to teach the layman how to do just what we're learning
how to do.

This repository will be built by a couple friends who 
are learning C, for both our own understanding and for
the understanding of any beginner who may wish to learn.

Either it will be super cool, or we'll get lazy and
never finish it. If the latter, fork this shit and 
continue on.

Godspeed,

sashimii
